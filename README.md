This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you will need to install Dependencies for Application. by running below commands.

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

## Step 2: Right Now this Application is configured for IOS only so we need to run below command to install IOS bundles

Open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your iOS app:

### iOS

```sh
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

## Step 3: Start Application By running below command

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).
